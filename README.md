<!--

When I add this code, the name of the extension is “N Prep School Auto Play”, but the repository name says “Nyobikou”

There is a reason for this, and it's because the official accounts on YouTube and other sites use that name, but I didn't like it myself, so I changed the name of the extension!

2024/04/29 - Added - decided to unify names
